We introduce Referring Human Perceptions and propose RefHCM, a unified framework that employs sequence mergers to convert raw multimodal data into semantic tokens, enabling diverse human-centric referring tasks to be reformulated into a sequence-to-sequence paradigm. RefHCM effectively facilitates knowledge transfer across tasks and exhibits capabilities in handling complex reasoning.
